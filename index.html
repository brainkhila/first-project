Lastly, Barcelona players also emphasize the importance of mental preparation. They believe that having a strong team mentality and being mentally tough can help them overcome any obstacles and come out victorious.

In conclusion, the key to beating Real Madrid FC according to Barcelona players is to dominate possession, exploit weaknesses, and be mentally prepared. While this may not guarantee victory every time, it has proven to be an effective strategy for Barca in the past.
